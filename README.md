Nelder-Mead Simplex Algorithm - searching local minimum of every unlimited funtion.
Available math functions: sin,cos,sqrt,exp,fabs,tan,log.

This repository contains desktop application of Simplex method in Python.

Requied liblaries (pip install):
- Sympy
- Numpy
- Matplotlib

Example usage:
First edit bar: fill it with your math function, variables can be named by letter and then any number. Unique names of variables describes dimension of function. 
Second edit bar: Paste starting point parameters in blackles [], values must have same dimmension as your function. Values correspond in order to unique variables filed higher.
Third edit bar: Stop parameter, minimum error reqied.

Output:
If dimmension is 2, then will be plotted two graphs. First contain 3d plot, second is their contour line.
Left bar: Output parameters, choosen last point of iteration.
Right bar: Next iterable points and their values.
